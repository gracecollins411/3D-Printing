<h1>3D Printing</h1>
<h2>Ender 3 Pro</h2>
  
<p>3D printing is a new way to create innovative and creative products right in your own home.</p>
  
<h3>How to Find</h3>
<p>First you need to find a reliable and affordable 3D printer. I like the website Creality 3D and the Ender 3 Pro is a good deal.</p>

<h3>How to Use</h3>
<p>You will get the printer in parts so watch this video:</p>

<p>After you assemble the 3D printer choose an STL file from any resource you want. A good website is Thingiverse:</p>

<p>You will then have to transfer the STL file to a software that will be able to connect to your 3D printer. I like the software Cura by Ultimaker:</p>
<a href="https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura"</a>
<p>Upon dragging the STL file to Cura you will be able to resize and scale the 3D print.</p>
  
<h3>How to Print</h3>
<p>Plug the USB with file card that came with the printer into your computer. Save the file to the USB and push the card into the 3D printer. Turn the 3D printer on, click on "print from TF", and select your file.</p>
<p>Now the plate will start heating up and your print will be on its way!</p>
